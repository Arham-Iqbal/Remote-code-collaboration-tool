## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_LINK
   cd remote-code-collaboration-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Navigate to the frontend and backend directories to install required packages:
   ```bash
   # For the frontend
   cd client
   npm install

   # For the backend
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend server**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Start the server by running:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Start the frontend application**:
   Open a new terminal and run:
